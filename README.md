## General Information
- This is multiclass classification model using custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- This project will help user to accurately detect melanoma which accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- Historical data set consists of many images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).


## Conclusions
- Model has formed well on both set training and validation set.
- Train Accuracy & Train Loss has similar range against Validation Accuracy & Validation Loss respectively.
- Model is almost free from overfitting and underfitting issues.
- Class rebalance solution is effective for this case.


<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Acknowledgements
- This project was based on knowledge shared under convolutional neural network course.
